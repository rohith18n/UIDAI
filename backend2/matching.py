"""
Fingerprint minutiae matching — kNN graph matching with relaxation labeling.

Single source of truth. Previously this algorithm existed as three separate copies
(app.py, slap_app.py, benchmark.py) which had already begun to drift apart.

Despite past references to this as "MCC-style", it is not the Minutia Cylinder-Code
algorithm (Cappelli, Ferrara & Maltoni, 2010) — no cylinder structures are built. It's
a k-nearest-neighbour graph with relaxation labeling, closer in spirit to Ratha/Jain-
style local-structure matching. See MATCHING_ALGORITHMS.md for a real MCC candidate
and other alternatives under evaluation.

match_templates(t1, t2, algorithm=...) dispatches by name through the _ALGORITHMS
registry at the bottom of this file. Two algorithms are registered today:

  "legacy"   Byte-for-byte behaviour of the original app.py matcher. Kept so that
             before/after numbers can be measured on identical data.

  "modern"   Default. Fixes the defect that made the original score 0% TAR on real
             phone captures: the edge descriptor was measured in absolute image
             space, so rotating the finger between enrol and authenticate shifted
             every edge angle and destroyed the match.

What changed in the default path
--------------------------------
1. Rotation-invariant edges. `_compute_edge` stored atan2(dy,dx) in image coordinates.
   It now stores that angle relative to p1's own ridge direction. Distance and relative
   orientation were already invariant; this was the one component that was not.

2. Node compatibility no longer gates on absolute position or absolute orientation.
   The original required two minutiae to sit within 25 units of the same place after
   centroid alignment, which cannot survive rotation. Candidate pairs are now filtered
   by minutia type plus a rotation-invariant neighbourhood distance signature, and the
   graph does the discriminating.

3. Robust scaling. The original divided by the bounding-box span, so a single spurious
   minutia at the edge rescaled the whole template. Now uses median nearest-neighbour
   distance.

4. Score reflects match quality, not just match count. The original returned a Dice
   coefficient over the number of surviving pairs and discarded everything the
   relaxation step computed. The score now blends coverage with the mean confidence of
   the assigned pairs.

# the last step — _match_modern assigns pairs greedily (highest relaxation probability
# first, skip anything whose row or column is already taken); this instead poses it as

# (scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment), so a locally-attractive greedy pick can no
# longer block a globally better configuration. Isolating this one change is the
# point — everything downstream (the coverage/confidence score) is left identical to
# _match_modern so any score difference between the two is attributable to the
